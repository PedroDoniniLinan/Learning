With 5 years of experience in data (most of it remotely), specializing in SQL, DBT, Python, Airlfow and AWS, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. Having worked in a company from its early stages, has given me the opportunity to interact and manage stakeholders across multiple departments and profiles (developers, PMs, sales agents, C levels, etc) with competing priorities using Kanban and Scrum methodologies.
I also led the design and implementation of ELT pipelines and datamarts for all company. While I focus on building robust and long-term solutions, I am equally adept at delivering quick and actionable insights when needed, ensuring that immediate business needs are met without compromising the overall architecture. My approach combines both speed and sustainability, making me a trusted resource for getting things done efficiently. I work well with my team, often helping to brainstorm solutions and tackle complex data tasks.
