## ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

Data is transformed before being loaded into the destination (e.g., data warehouse). Suitable for on-premises systems or when transformation needs to occur before storage.

## ELT (Extract, Load, Transform): 

Data is loaded first into the data warehouse or data lake, and transformations happen post-loading. Common in cloud-based environments where storage is scalable, and you can leverage the warehouse's processing power.

## When to choose:

- ETL: When data needs to be cleaned or processed before loading, or in environments with strict data governance.
- ELT: When working with large datasets in a cloud environment, allowing faster ingestion and leveraging the cloud's processing power for transformation.

## Data quality and accuracy

- Data validation checks at each stage (e.g., checking for null values, duplicates).
- Using data observability tools to monitor data freshness and lineage.
- Implementing unit tests within dbt models to verify transformation logic.
- Setting up alerting mechanisms to detect anomalies or data discrepancies early.
